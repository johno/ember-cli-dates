```

### Day of the Week

## Locale Support

In order to add locale support, you need to import the locale file in your app's `Brocfile.js`:

```js
app.import(app.bowerDirectory + '/moment/locale/pt-br.js');
```

You then have the ability to specify any imported locale with:

```hbs
{{time-format createdAt 'LLLL' 'pt-br'}}
{{time-ahead-in-words nextHour 'pt-br'}}
```
